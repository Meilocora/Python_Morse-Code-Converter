# Python_Morse-Code-Converter
My solution for "Day 82 - Professional Portfolio Project" of the udemy course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"

The task was to create a python program, that converts text into morse code.
I implemented a solution that also converts morse code into text.
